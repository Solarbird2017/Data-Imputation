# Data-Imputation
Handling the missing data problems.
1. Impute the data by calculating the maximum likelihood iteratively.
2. Imputation accuracy is verified with different Machine Learning classifiers and Neural Networks.
3. Scikit-learn and Pytorch packages need to be installed before running the Python code.

We use the algorithm to handling the missing data problem in electronic health records (EHRs). Due to the privacy, we cannot release the original EHR dataset.
